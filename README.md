## Design Principles Guide

This is a repo containing the background information on design principles and a guide on how to create design principles for your project. The template for this guide is a 
[CFPB/DOCter](https://github.com/CFPB/DOCter)-based
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) template which is used for all
[18F Guides](http://18f.github.io/guides/).

### Why Create This Guide

Design Principles play a key role in the underlying success of any design project. They differ from traditional visual design principles as they speak to the resulting experience of a person interacting with a digital solution. 

The goal of this guide is to assist other design teams in feeling confident in creating and maintaining their own design principles.

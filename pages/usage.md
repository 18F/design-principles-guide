## Usage

### Product planning

It’s important that any product plan has features lined up that not only build on top of each other but serve the future needs of the end user. Design principles are helpful here because they serve as filters for determining development priority.

### Generate ideas

Brainstorming occurs frequently during a product development lifecycle. The best seeds for trying to come up with new ideas, designs, or features are the design principles that have been guiding the product’s development. It gives you the ability to evaluate the outcome of brainstorming sessions against a defined set of criteria.

### Design

For designers, design principles are used in a few different ways.

**Onboarding team members**

When new team members join the product team, design principles provide them with an overview and primer on the purpose and goals of the product. They can also serve as a history lesson that gives the new team member context on all the past decisions that have been made to date.

**Shared language**

It’s important for all members of the team describe the product in similar terms, this allows the conversation to flow during collaboration and critique sessions. As well as day to day conversation about the project. If the members of the team actively use the design principles throughout the design and development process, all members of the team will refer to different aspects of the product in the same manner.

### Evaluate

During evaluation, design principles guide and support feedback. Based on the defined principles, the team can define what kind of feedback it wants. When reviewing the feedback, the principles help filter out feedback that may not apply to the product or its next iteration.
